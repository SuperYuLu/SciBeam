# SciBeam
Scientific Data AnalyzeTool for Time Series Beam Measurement.  

**SciBeam** is an open source library for analyzing time series beam measurement data. Using pandas dataframe and series as it's base classing, additional time series related featured are added for quick analysis, such as file name matching, gaussian fitting, peak analysis, noise filtering, plotting, etc. It's flexible method chain enables you to perform fast data analysis on any beam-like data.   

SciBeam is originally designed for experimental physics data analysis. The library has been tested in the daily data analysis and is under active development in terms of bredth and deepth of scientific computation.  

## Status  
Under testing, release soon...
